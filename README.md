# Turing Machine Simulation

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine
that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.Despite the model's simplicity, 
given any computer algorithm, a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.
